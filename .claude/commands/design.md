If there are any links in $ARGUMENTS, please refer to them.
If not, please ask what the design is for.

Please create a design document following the framework below
and output it as a file in Japanese.
Please write carefully without omissions.
However, you don't need to write much code.
It would be helpful if you could include various diagrams,
such as ER diagrams, flowcharts, sequence diagrams,
and system architecture diagrams.
Please draw diagrams using Mermaid.
If there are any unclear or ambiguous points,
be sure to document them in this DesignDoc
and resolve all issues before finalizing it.
