# Implement Codes

Please begin implementation based on the DesignDoc in $ARGUMENTS.
Always create a development branch from the latest main branch
before starting work.
For large-scale development,
split implementation tasks and proceed step by step.
Avoid committing immediately.
Implement up to a point where functionality can be verified,
obtain approval for that change, and commit afterward.

Finally, thoroughly review the entire implemented scope.
Conduct a self-review from a senior engineer's perspective,
identifying points needing correction, improvement, or refactoring,
before requesting a review.
